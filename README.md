# Why I find it interesting
This article offers a very candid and detailed glimpse into the life of a software engineer, featuring Lindsey Redd, who has worked for tech giants like Slack and Lyft. 
What captivated me the most was Lindsey's journey from pursuing a medical career to thriving in software engineering, a field she only discovered in college.
I found her emphasis on **communication and collaboration** as important skills for success in software engineering refreshing as these are often overlooked by techinical abilities.
Additionally, the article breaks down the diverse paths within the field, from infrastructure engineering to mobile development which highlights the flexibility and creativity found in this profession. 
Lindsey's experience in this male-dominated industry and her preparation for intense technical interviews resonates with me deeply. It serves as an inspiring reminder that persistence, curiosity, and community support can help anyone overcome barriers. 
Furthermore, the interview style of this article made the entire experience more personal, like a one and one conversation between Lindsey and the audience.

I particularly enjoyed how Lindsey highlights the critical role of collaboration in her daily work. 
It's a reminder that even in a highly technical field like software engineering, teamwork and strong interpersonal skills can make a significant difference. It made me reflect on how these principles apply not only to engineering but to nearly every profession.
